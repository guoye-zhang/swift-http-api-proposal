/// A protocol that represents an asynchronous writer that produces a final value upon completion.

/// ``ConcludingAsyncWriter`` adds functionality to asynchronous writers that need to
/// provide a conclusive element after writing is complete. This is particularly useful
/// for streams that have meaningful completion states, such as HTTP response that need
/// to finalize with optional trailers.
